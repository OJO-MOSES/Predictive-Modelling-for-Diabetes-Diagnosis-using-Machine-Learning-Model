# Predictive-Modelling-for-Diabetes-Diagnosis-using-Machine-Learning-Model

## Project Overview

Diabetes is growing global health concern, with millions of people affected worldwide. Accurate and timely diagnosis of diabetes is crucial to prevent complications and improve patient outcome.
In this analysis, I leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that identifies individuals at high risk of developing diabetes.
I utilized a comprehensive dataset containing medical history, laboratory results and lifestlye habit from 768 patients.

## Methodology

1.	Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis.
2.	Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant patterns and relationships in the data
3.	Model selection: Evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the most effective one.
4.	Model training: Training the selected model using the preprocessed data.
5.	Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics.

## Results

The analysis demonstrates that machine learning-based predictive model can accurately identify individuals at high risk factors developing diabetes with accuracy level of 78%.
